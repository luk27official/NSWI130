# patient monitor control (PMC)

- the purpose of PMC (patient monitor control) module is to keep information about every patient which is present in the hospital, to get an effective view of the patient's current health state from all the machines, prescribed medication (including dosages) and a camera capturing the patient to be sure that he is doing okay

- in this module we have the following stakeholders:
  - patients - to be taken care of
  - doctors - to prescribe medication for patients
  - management - to make sure everyone does their work
  - medical staff - to take care of patients and potentially react to critical state of patients
  - technical staff - to take care of all devices 
  - IT developers - to create an architecture and to make sure everything works properly

- some technical stuff to be dealt with:
  - all of the electronical devices monitoring the state (ECG, ...)
  - medication + dosages
  - current room
  - camera to the patient's bed
  - possibly some details of his including the doctor etc.

TODO: cleanup this and possibly extend more/add a diagram...
