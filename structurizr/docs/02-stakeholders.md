## Stakeholders

In this module we have the following stakeholders:
  - **Patients**
To be taken care of, bigger trust in doctor´s work (medication won´t mix up, someone is always watching if emergency occurs).
  - **Doctors** 
To prescribe medication for patients, to monitor changes in patient state and possibly discover underlying problems.
  - **Management**
To make sure everyone does their work, creating safer environment to maintain patients and good name.
  - **Medical staff**
To take care of patients and potentially react to critical state of patients, to avoid constant running from one room to another pointlessly, better vision of patient´s history to avoid unnecessary/dangerous combinations of treatment.
  - **Technical staff**
To take care of all devices.
  - **IT developers**
To create an architecture and to make sure everything works properly. They also secure integration with other hospital systems.

There is some technical stuff to be dealt with as well:
  - all of the electronical devices monitoring the state (ECG, ...)
  - medication + dosages
  - current room status
  - camera pointed to the patient's bed
